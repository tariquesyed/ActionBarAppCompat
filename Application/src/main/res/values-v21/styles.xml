        This is the styled theme.

        It extends from Theme.AppCompat.Light, but it could extend from any of
        the Theme.AppCompat themes depending on your color scheme. This theme can be applied to
        your application or individual activities in the AndroidManifest.xml. In this sample it is
        set on the application.

        This differs from the version of this theme in 'res/values-v14', as not all of the
        necessary attributes are available in the android: namespace on older versions of Android.
        This means that for certain attributes we must set the attributes provided in
        ActionBarCompat's namespace instead.
